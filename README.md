# KinemaKritik
Website for reviews and ratings of Movies &amp; TV Series | **My graduation project**

Only Russian language is available.

### UPD - July 1, 2024:
I've graduated on **June 25, 2024**, got an "Excelent" ("5" or "A") and was noted that my work was done on a high-level ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ Hooray!

Now, I'll archive the repository.

### UPD - December 25, 2024:
Removed from archiving just to add screenshots and remove the license. Tried to run code, but couldn't because I don't have some available database right now. :P

I could redo most of the project code looking at it now, but I won't. Let it stay that way.
